# Enabling Modbus TCP on SolarEdge Inverter
1. Enable wifi direct on the inverter by switching the red toggle switch on the inverter to "P" position for less than 5 seconds.
2. Connect to the inverter access point like you would for a normal wifi network. The wifi password is published at the right side of the inverter. 
3. Open up a browser and go to http://172.16.0.1 > Site Communication. From this webpage you can enable modbus TCP without setApp or installer account.
